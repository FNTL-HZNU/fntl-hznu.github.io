### 摘要

<p>Software defined networking (SDN) can bring considerable flexibility to the management of inter-DC elastic optical networks. However, in the large-scale network, unreasonable placement of multiple SDN controllers may cause the unbalanced distribution of controller loads. To address this issue, we propose a two-sided matching method (TSMM) and design its corresponding algorithm to implement the optimal multicontroller placement. We solve the controller placement problem as the two-sided matching problem and consider optimizing multiple metrics which affect the controller placement. Different from previous research ideas, TSMM implements placement choice from the bilateral perspective of switch and controller. Additionally, TSMM algorithm can achieve the optimal controller placement by maximizing mutual satisfaction between controller and switch. The simulation results show that TSMM can achieve the optimal multi-controller placement and the balanced distribution of controller loads when compared with the existing schemes.</p>
