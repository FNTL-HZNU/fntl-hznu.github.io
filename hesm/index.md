### 摘要

<p>In elastic optical inter-datacenter networks, multiple software-defined networking (SDN) controllers have been used to improve scalability and reliability. The static controller deployment faces the problem of controller load imbalance under dynamic changes in network traffic. In response to this problem, existing research works proposed to use dynamic switch migration to achieve the controller load balancing. However, the efficiency of the existing switch migration is low, because the load balancing performance of controllers does not improve significantly after the switch migration and the migration activities can also cause additional migration costs. Thus the efficiency of switch migration has not yet been well resolved. In this work, we propose a highlyefficient switch migration (HESM) for controller load balancing. The proposed HESM method defines multiple load metrics to measure the load of controllers, and selects the optimal target controller with the largest remaining resource, which improves the load balancing performance. HESM selects switches based on minimizing migration costs, reducing additional migration costs. In addition, HESM can handle the load of multiple controllers in parallel during a switch migration activity, which improves the efficiency of migration. The simulation results show that HESM significantly improves load balancing performance of controllers and reduces the migration cost compared to existing solutions.</p>
