With the exponential growth in data transmission and processing demands, the issues related to the performance and efficiency of DCN have become increasingly urgent and complex. However, flow in DCN exhibits distinct characteristics compared to traditional networks, including uneven flow volume distribution, bursty transmission demands, and intricate network topologies. Conventional flow optimization strategies often fall short in this unique context. In recent years, researchers have actively proposed a plethora of innovative flow optimization strategies to address the challenges of enhancing the performance and efficiency of DCN. This survey aims to comprehensively review and analyze flow optimization strategies in DCN, encompassing various key areas of research and development dynamics such as load balancing, congestion control, routing optimization, flow scheduling, and flow security. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth discussion of the strengths and limitations of existing strategies to equip researchers with a comprehensive understanding and framework for this field. Moreover, this article explores future research prospects and trends to guide further innovative work in meeting the ever-growing demands of DCN. ​ 链 接 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084804524000602 出版物 Journal of Network and Computer Applications, JNCA 2024 ","date":"2024-07-19","objectID":"/flow-optimization-strategies/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["流量优化","负载均衡","拥塞控制","路由优化","流量调度"],"title":"Flow optimization strategies in data center networks: A survey","uri":"/flow-optimization-strategies/#摘要"},{"categories":["期刊论文"],"content":" 摘要The Software-Defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) utilizes the centralized control and programmability of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) to enhance network performance optimization and efficient resource utilization in IoT.

However, existing load balancing strategies struggle to address potential future load imbalances,which can adversely affect network quality. Current load balancing solutions rely on real-time data collection to determine the status of a controller. However, during the time between identifying a load imbalance and completing migration, the overloaded state of the controller can negatively impact the network. Accurate prediction of controller load and proactive switch migration can effectively reduce the duration of the controller’s load imbalance state, thereby improving load balancing efficiency. Controller load mainly comes from processing Packet_in messages, making it essential to accurately predict the transmission rate of these messages for each switch managed by the controller. Traditional time-series prediction models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), can effectively process time-series data and exhibit memory and temporal dependency processing capabilities, achieving good prediction results. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was used to predict controller load, demonstrating the feasibility of load prediction. However, the traditional LSTM model typically uses the final hidden state to predict, which can lead to the loss of valuable information contained in intermediate hidden states, especially when processing long sequences. As the performance of controller load balancing is directly impacted by the accuracy of the model’s prediction, it is crucial to improve the prediction accuracy. To improve the accuracy of the prediction model, we propose a new controller load prediction model based on the traditional LSTM model, called Attention-LSTM. We integrate attention mechanisms into LSTM, taking into account the hidden state of each LSTM time step, effectively improving the accuracy of the final prediction results. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy than existing models on the same dataset. ​ 链 接 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600061.3603124 出版物 2023: 7th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking, APNET 2023 ","date":"2023-07-19","objectID":"/att-lstm/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["负载预测","SDN","负载均衡"],"title":"Attention-based LSTM for Controller Load Prediction in Software-Defined Networks","uri":"/att-lstm/#引言"},{"categories":["期刊论文"],"content":" 摘要In inter-datacenter elastic optical networks, multi-controller deployment is adopted to improve the stability and scalability of the control plane. As the network scale increases, the traditional multi-controller deployment scheme ignores the dynamic characteristics of traffic, resulting in unbalanced load among multiple controllers. In response to this problem, the existing switch migration mechanism is proposed to achieve balanced distribution of control loads. However, most of the existing research work does not consider the additional cost of switch migration, and the load balancing performance of the controller is not significantly improved after switch migration. In this paper, we propose a cost-aware switch migration (CASM) strategy for controller load balancing. The proposed CASM strategy first measures the controller load through multiple performance indicators that affect the controller load, and then judges whether the controller is overloaded or underloaded based on the controller’s response time to the request message, thereby improving the load balancing performance of the controller. Additionally, when selecting the switch to be migrated, the CASM selects the optimal switch for migration based on minimizing the migration cost, thereby reducing the cost of switch migration. The performance evaluation shows that CASM significantly improves load balancing performance of controllers and reduces the migration cost compared to existing solutions. ​ 链 接 https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6732/9/5/315 出版物 Photonics,2022 ","date":"2022-05-06","objectID":"/casm/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["弹性光网络","负载均衡","控制器部署","交换机迁移","迁移成本"],"title":"CASM: A Cost-Aware Switch Migration Strategy for Elastic Optical Inter-Datacenter Networks","uri":"/casm/#摘要"},{"categories":["期刊论文"],"content":" 摘要Data center networks demand high-performance, robust, and scalable load balancing protocols. Despite progress, existing work still cannot meet these requirements well. Software defined networking (SDN) can bring considerable flexibility to the management of data center networks. In the software-defined data center network, we design, analyze, and evaluate RSLB, a robust and scalable load balancing protocol that overcomes these challenges. RSLB uses fine-grained flowcell as the transmission unit, and uses link delay as the congestion metric. It uses a threestep routing strategy to route flowcells to the path with the least congestion. Through global congestion awareness, RSLB reduces flow completion time (FCT), and is more robust to topological asymmetries compared to existing congestion-agnostic schemes. To collect and store congestion information, RSLB adopts a distributed control structure that monitors the congestion of the entire network through multiple controllers, which makes it much more scalable for implementation in large-scale networks compare to existing congestion-aware schemes. The simulation results show that RSLB can achieve lower FCT for mice flows and higher throughput for elephant flows than existing schemes, no matter in failure-free topology or asymmetric topology. ​ 链 接 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9832649 出版物 IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, TNSM 2021 ","date":"2021-12-08","objectID":"/rslb/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["数据中心网络","SDN","负载均衡","拥塞控制","分布式控制"],"title":"RSLB: Robust and Scalable Load Balancing in Software-Defined Data Center Networks","uri":"/rslb/#摘要"},{"categories":["期刊论文"],"content":" 摘要In elastic optical inter-datacenter networks, multiple software-defined networking (SDN) controllers have been used to improve scalability and reliability. The static controller deployment faces the problem of controller load imbalance under dynamic changes in network traffic. In response to this problem, existing research works proposed to use dynamic switch migration to achieve the controller load balancing. However, the efficiency of the existing switch migration is low, because the load balancing performance of controllers does not improve significantly after the switch migration and the migration activities can also cause additional migration costs. Thus the efficiency of switch migration has not yet been well resolved. In this work, we propose a highlyefficient switch migration (HESM) for controller load balancing. The proposed HESM method defines multiple load metrics to measure the load of controllers, and selects the optimal target controller with the largest remaining resource, which improves the load balancing performance. HESM selects switches based on minimizing migration costs, reducing additional migration costs. In addition, HESM can handle the load of multiple controllers in parallel during a switch migration activity, which improves the efficiency of migration. The simulation results show that HESM significantly improves load balancing performance of controllers and reduces the migration cost compared to existing solutions. ​ 链 接 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9376772 出版物 IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, JSAC 2021 ","date":"2021-09-19","objectID":"/hesm/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["交换机迁移","SDN","迁移成本","负载均衡"],"title":"Highly-Efficient Switch Migration for Controller Load Balancing in Elastic Optical Inter-Datacenter Networks","uri":"/hesm/#摘要"},{"categories":["期刊论文"],"content":" 摘要The Software-Defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) utilizes the centralized control and programmability of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) to enhance network performance optimization and efficient resource utilization in IoT.

As network failures occur frequently, data center networks demand highly performed, robust, and energy-efcient failure recovery mechanisms. Despite process, the existing work still has a huge scope to improve to satisfy these requirements. The backup-based failure recovery schemes reserve backup paths in advance, which results in a large energy consumption under normal network conditions. In order to solve the energy consumption problem, the existing adaptive failure recovery schemes are proposed to calculate the rerouting path of the trafc on the failed link, which reduces the energy consumption. However, most adaptive fault recovery solutions apply multi-path routing to calculate the re-routing path. As multi-path routing cannot detect the congestion status of the path under the asymmetric topology caused by link failures, the network is congested, which ends up in less robustness of the network. In view of this, we design and evaluate AFRM, a novel adaptive failure recovery mechanism that overcomes these challenges. AFRM uses asymmetrical routing to calculate the re-routing path by being congestion-aware and is more robust to topological asymmetries compared with existing schemes. The asymmetrical routing dynamically schedules fows to the path with the least marginal cost, which makes AFRM much more energy-efcient. Additionally, AFRM achieves fast link failure detection based on hash storage and fow table matching. Evaluations show that AFRM can do the trade-of between failure recovery time and energy consumption, reduce fow completion time, and increase network throughput compared with existing schemes. ​ 链 接 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-020-03337-4 出版物 Journal of Supercomputing, SUPE 2020 ","date":"2020-06-03","objectID":"/afrm/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["数据中心网络","故障恢复","边际成本","非对称路由"],"title":"An adaptive failure recovery mechanism based on asymmetric routing for data center networks","uri":"/afrm/#摘要"},{"categories":["会议论文"],"content":" 摘要Software defined networking (SDN) can bring considerable flexibility to the management of inter-DC elastic optical networks. However, in the large-scale network, unreasonable placement of multiple SDN controllers may cause the unbalanced distribution of controller loads. To address this issue, we propose a two-sided matching method (TSMM) and design its corresponding algorithm to implement the optimal multicontroller placement. We solve the controller placement problem as the two-sided matching problem and consider optimizing multiple metrics which affect the controller placement. Different from previous research ideas, TSMM implements placement choice from the bilateral perspective of switch and controller. Additionally, TSMM algorithm can achieve the optimal controller placement by maximizing mutual satisfaction between controller and switch. The simulation results show that TSMM can achieve the optimal multi-controller placement and the balanced distribution of controller loads when compared with the existing schemes. ​ 链 接 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9149309 出版物 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2020 ","date":"2020-05-20","objectID":"/tsmm-icc/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["控制器部署","SDN","双边匹配","数据中心间弹性光网络"],"title":"Multi-Controller Placement Based on Two-Sided Matching in Inter-Datacenter Elastic Optical Networks","uri":"/tsmm-icc/#摘要"},{"categories":null,"content":" 研究人员 刘勇，杭州师范大学信息科学与技术学院副教授，硕士生导师，杭州市高层次人才E类，CCF会员，IEEE会员。2021年博士毕业于西安电子科技大学通信与信息系统专业，在通信网络领域具有深入的研究。先后发表过学术论文10余篇，其中包括通信网络领域顶级期刊（IEEE-JSAC），通信领域旗舰型会议（IEEE-ICC 2020），以及云计算领域顶级期刊（IEEE-TCC）；申请和授权国家发明专利4项；担任IEEE-TNSM、TPDS、TCC、JNCA、IEEE-CL等国际高水平期刊审稿人；先后参与和主持国家自然科学基金项目3项、浙江省自然科学基金项目1项、华为公司与高校合作项目4项等。 个人主页：https://hise.hznu.edu.cn/c/2022-03-22/2672991.shtml ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/%E8%AF%BE%E9%A2%98%E7%BB%84%E6%88%90%E5%91%98/:0:1","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"课题组成员","uri":"/%E8%AF%BE%E9%A2%98%E7%BB%84%E6%88%90%E5%91%98/#研究人员"},{"categories":null,"content":" 在读学生 刘权泽，硕士研究生，2022-至今 硕士导师：刘勇 研究方向：软件定义网络中控制平面负载均衡机制研究 发表论文： Liu Q, Liu Y, Meng Q, et al.
