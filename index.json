[{"categories":["会议论文"],"content":" 引言Implementing load balancing for the control plane of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) can improve network reliability, scalability, and overall performance. However, existing load balancing strategies struggle to address potential future load imbalances,which can adversely affect network quality. Current load balancing solutions rely on real-time data collection to determine the status of a controller. However, during the time between identifying a load imbalance and completing migration, the overloaded state of the controller can negatively impact the network. Accurate prediction of controller load and proactive switch migration can effectively reduce the duration of the controller’s load imbalance state, thereby improving load balancing efficiency. Controller load mainly comes from processing Packet_in messages, making it essential to accurately predict the transmission rate of these messages for each switch managed by the controller. Traditional time-series prediction models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), can effectively process time-series data and exhibit memory and temporal dependency processing capabilities, achieving good prediction results. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was used to predict controller load, demonstrating the feasibility of load prediction. However, the traditional LSTM model typically uses the final hidden state to predict, which can lead to the loss of valuable information contained in intermediate hidden states, especially when processing long sequences. As the performance of controller load balancing is directly impacted by the accuracy of the model’s prediction, it is crucial to improve the prediction accuracy. To improve the accuracy of the prediction model, we propose a new controller load prediction model based on the traditional LSTM model, called Attention-LSTM. We integrate attention mechanisms into LSTM, taking into account the hidden state of each LSTM time step, effectively improving the accuracy of the final prediction results. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy than existing models on the same dataset. 链 接 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084804524000602 出版物 2023: 7th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking, APNET 2023 ","date":"2024-07-19","objectID":"/att-lstm/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["负载预测","SDN","负载均衡"],"title":"Attention-based LSTM for Controller Load Prediction in Software-Defined Networks","uri":"/att-lstm/#引言"},{"categories":["期刊论文"],"content":" 摘要In the era of digitization, Data Center Networks (DCN) have emerged as a critical component supporting infrastructure for cloud computing, big data analytics, online services, and more. With the exponential growth in data transmission and processing demands, the issues related to the performance and efficiency of DCN have become increasingly urgent and complex. However, flow in DCN exhibits distinct characteristics compared to traditional networks, including uneven flow volume distribution, bursty transmission demands, and intricate network topologies. Conventional flow optimization strategies often fall short in this unique context. In recent years, researchers have actively proposed a plethora of innovative flow optimization strategies to address the challenges of enhancing the performance and efficiency of DCN. This survey aims to comprehensively review and analyze flow optimization strategies in DCN, encompassing various key areas of research and development dynamics such as load balancing, congestion control, routing optimization, flow scheduling, and flow security. Furthermore, it provides an in-depth discussion of the strengths and limitations of existing strategies to equip researchers with a comprehensive understanding and framework for this field. Moreover, this article explores future research prospects and trends to guide further innovative work in meeting the ever-growing demands of DCN. ​ 链 接 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1084804524000602 出版物 Journal of Network and Computer Applications, JNCA 2024 ","date":"2024-07-19","objectID":"/flow-optimization-strategies/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["流量优化","负载均衡","拥塞控制","路由优化","流量调度"],"title":"Flow optimization strategies in data center networks: A survey","uri":"/flow-optimization-strategies/#摘要"},{"categories":["期刊论文"],"content":" 摘要The Software-Defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) utilizes the centralized control and programmability of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) to enhance network performance optimization and efficient resource utilization in IoT. As the network scale expands, the multiple-controller architecture becomes crucial for ensuring reliability and scalability in SD-IoT. However, the dynamic changes in traffic patterns often lead to imbalanced loads among controllers. Existing solutions primarily focus on switch migration schemes, but traditional schemes primarily rely on real-time data to assess controller loads, which fails to predict future controller loads and leads to unnecessary switch migrations. Meanwhile, existing schemes frequently encounter the challenge of overloading the target controller, leading to reduced migration efficiency. Furthermore, conventional schemes tend to overlook the issue of isolated nodes that arise from switch migrations, thereby compromising network reliability and security. To address these challenges, we propose bidirectional switch migration based on load prediction (BSM-LP), which utilizes an ATT-GRU model to accurately predict controller loads based on historical load data, thereby preventing unnecessary switch migrations. Moreover, we introduce a bidirectional switch migration algorithm that enhances migration efficiency while avoiding overloading the target controller. Additionally, we present an algorithm for identifying and integrating isolated nodes to reduce their occurrence. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of BSMLP, and the experimental results demonstrate that it reduces the load imbalance rate by an average of 22.3% and the response time by 30.5% compared to existing schemes. ​ 链 接 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600061.3603124 出版物 IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IoTJ 2024 ","date":"2024-07-08","objectID":"/bsm-lp/:0:1","series":null,"tags":["交换机迁移","负载均衡","负载预测","SDN","物联网"],"title":"BSM-LP: Bidirectional Switch Migration with Controller Load Prediction for Software-Defined Internet of Things.","uri":"/bsm-lp/#摘要"},{"categories":null,"content":" 研究人员 刘勇，男，工学博士，副教授，硕士生导师，杭州市高层次人才E类，CCF会员，IEEE会员。在通信网络领域具有深入的研究，先后发表过学术论文10余篇，其中包括通信网络领域顶级期刊（IEEE-JSAC），通信领域旗舰型会议（IEEE-ICC 2020），以及云计算领域顶级期刊（IEEE-TCC）；申请和授权国家发明专利4项；担任IEEE-TNSM、TPDS、TCC、JNCA、IEEE-CL等国际高水平期刊审稿人；先后参与和主持国家自然科学基金项目3项、浙江省自然科学基金项目1项、华为公司与高校合作项目4项等。 个人主页：https://hise.hznu.edu.cn/c/2022-03-22/2672991.shtml ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/%E8%AF%BE%E9%A2%98%E7%BB%84%E6%88%90%E5%91%98/:0:1","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"课题组成员","uri":"/%E8%AF%BE%E9%A2%98%E7%BB%84%E6%88%90%E5%91%98/#研究人员"},{"categories":null,"content":" 在读学生 葛袁航，男， ","date":"0001-01-01","objectID":"/%E8%AF%BE%E9%A2%98%E7%BB%84%E6%88%90%E5%91%98/:0:2","series":null,"tags":null,"title":"课题组成员","uri":"/%E8%AF%BE%E9%A2%98%E7%BB%84%E6%88%90%E5%91%98/#在读学生"}]
