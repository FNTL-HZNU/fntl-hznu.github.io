    <description><![CDATA[摘要The Software-Defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) utilizes the centralized control and programmability of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) to enhance network performance optimization and efficient resource utilization in IoT. As the network scale expands, the multiple-controller architecture becomes crucial for ensuring reliability and scalability in SD-IoT. However, the dynamic changes in traffic patterns often lead to imbalanced loads among controllers. Existing solutions primarily focus on switch migration schemes,]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要In inter-datacenter elastic optical networks, multi-controller deployment is adopted to improve the stability and scalability of the control plane. As the network scale increases, the traditional multi-controller deployment scheme ignores the dynamic characteristics of traffic, resulting in unbalanced load among multiple controllers. In response to this problem, the existing switch migration mechanism is proposed to achieve balanced distribution of control loads. However, most of the existing research]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要In elastic optical inter-datacenter networks, multiple software-defined networking (SDN) controllers have been used to improve scalability and reliability. The static controller deployment faces the problem of controller load imbalance under dynamic changes in network traffic. In response to this problem, existing research works proposed to use dynamic switch migration to achieve the controller load balancing. However, the efficiency of the existing switch migration is low, because the]]></description>
