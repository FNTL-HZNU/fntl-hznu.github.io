    <description><![CDATA[摘要Data center networks demand high-performance, robust, and scalable load balancing protocols. Despite progress, existing work still cannot meet these requirements well. Software defined networking (SDN) can bring considerable flexibility to the management of data center networks. In the software-defined data center network, we design, analyze, and evaluate RSLB, a robust and scalable load balancing protocol that overcomes these challenges. RSLB uses fine-grained flowcell as the]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要The Software-Defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) utilizes the centralized control and programmability of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) to enhance network performance optimization and efficient resource utilization in IoT. As the network scale expands, the multiple-controller architecture becomes crucial for ensuring reliability and scalability in SD-IoT. However, the dynamic changes in traffic patterns often lead to imbalanced loads among controllers. Existing solutions primarily focus on switch migration schemes,]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要As the infrastructure of high-performance computing, the data center network plays an important role. As network failures occur frequently, data center networks demand highly performed, robust, and energy-efcient failure recovery mechanisms. Despite process, the existing work still has a huge scope to improve to satisfy these requirements. The backup-based failure recovery schemes reserve backup paths in advance, which results in a large energy consumption under normal network]]></description>
