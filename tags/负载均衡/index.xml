    <description><![CDATA[摘要In the era of digitization, Data Center Networks (DCN) have emerged as a critical component supporting infrastructure for cloud computing, big data analytics, online services, and more. With the exponential growth in data transmission and processing demands, the issues related to the performance and efficiency of DCN have become increasingly urgent and complex. However, flow in DCN exhibits distinct characteristics compared to traditional networks, including uneven flow]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要The Software-Defined Internet of Things (SD-IoT) utilizes the centralized control and programmability of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) to enhance network performance optimization and efficient resource utilization in IoT. As the network scale expands, the multiple-controller architecture becomes crucial for ensuring reliability and scalability in SD-IoT. However, the dynamic changes in traffic patterns often lead to imbalanced loads among controllers. Existing solutions primarily focus on switch migration schemes,]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[引言Implementing load balancing for the control plane of SoftwareDefined Networking (SDN) can improve network reliability, scalability, and overall performance. However, existing load balancing strategies struggle to address potential future load imbalances,which can adversely affect network quality. Current load balancing solutions rely on real-time data collection to determine the status of a controller. However, during the time between]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要In inter-datacenter elastic optical networks, multi-controller deployment is adopted to improve the stability and scalability of the control plane. As the network scale increases, the traditional multi-controller deployment scheme ignores the dynamic characteristics of traffic, resulting in unbalanced load among multiple controllers. In response to this problem, the existing switch migration mechanism is proposed to achieve balanced distribution of control loads. However, most of the existing research]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要Data center networks demand high-performance, robust, and scalable load balancing protocols. Despite progress, existing work still cannot meet these requirements well. Software defined networking (SDN) can bring considerable flexibility to the management of data center networks. In the software-defined data center network, we design, analyze, and evaluate RSLB, a robust and scalable load balancing protocol that overcomes these challenges. RSLB uses fine-grained flowcell as the]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[摘要In elastic optical inter-datacenter networks, multiple software-defined networking (SDN) controllers have been used to improve scalability and reliability. The static controller deployment faces the problem of controller load imbalance under dynamic changes in network traffic. In response to this problem, existing research works proposed to use dynamic switch migration to achieve the controller load balancing. However, the efficiency of the existing switch migration is low, because the]]></description>
